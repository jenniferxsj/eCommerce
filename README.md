Authod: Shujun Xiao (Jennifer)

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to create a basic eCommerce application using Django, Python, and MySQL. Additionally, the project aims to establish the Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) environment for a three-tier application. This involves configuring the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), network connections, and security groups for various subnets to ensure a secure network environment. It also includes setting up subnets in different availability zones, Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), and Auto Scaling Group (ASG) to ensure the application's availability and scalability. Finally, the eCommerce app is successfully deployed on the cloud.
